# Nova
Nova is a cross-platform C++ library for quickly building GUI applications, inspired by the simplicity of Processing and the architecture of the [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) engine by [TheCherno](https://github.com/TheCherno). Nova aims to make both rapid prototyping and serious application development easy and efficient.

⚠️ Status: Early development\
Currently Linux is supported. Windows and macOS support are coming soon.
